This project analyzes credit card transactions and customer behavior using Power BI.
I created two dashboards — Credit Card Transaction Report and Credit Card Customer Report — to help understand revenue, spending patterns, customer segments, and business performance.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="business-problem"></a>Business Problem</h2>

Businesses often struggle to understand how customers use their credit cards and where revenue is coming from.
The goal was to identify:
- Which customer groups generate more revenue
- Which card categories perform best
- Trends in spending and transactions
- Areas to improve customer satisfaction

<h2><a class="anchor" id="dataset"></a>Dataset</h2>

The dataset contains credit card transactions and customer details.
Key columns include:
- Card Category
- Education
- Marital Status
- Age Group
This was a clean dataset with no missing values (or mention if you cleaned).
